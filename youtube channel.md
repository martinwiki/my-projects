# channels overview
From a young age, I was captivated by technology, constantly exploring how computers and software worked beyond their intended use. This curiosity led me to create multiple YouTube channels dating back to 2010, where I shared my discoveries and technical experiments with others.

# Early Passion for IT

My videos covered a range of topics, from software customization to creative scripting. Some of the projects I explored included:
Demonstrating software cracking techniques (purely for educational purposes and understanding security vulnerabilities).
Developing scripts that played pranks, such as placing a startup command to trigger an automatic shutdown upon login.
Tweaking system settings and exploring hidden features in operating systems and applications.
While these projects started as a way to explore technology in unconventional ways, they ultimately fueled my deeper interest in IT, networking, and cybersecurity. They provided a hands-on approach to understanding system behaviors, scripting, and troubleshooting—skills that would later become fundamental in my professional career.
# How This Experience Shaped My IT Career
Looking back, these early experiences were pivotal in shaping my technical mindset. They instilled a natural curiosity for problem-solving, a proactive approach to learning, and the ability to think critically about how systems operate under the hood.
Today, as an IT professional, I apply these same principles in a structured and ethical manner, focusing on:
Scripting & Automation – Using PowerShell, Bash, and other scripting tools to streamline processes and enhance efficiency.
Networking & System Administration – Understanding infrastructure, troubleshooting, and optimizing performance.
Security Awareness – Recognizing vulnerabilities and implementing best practices to safeguard systems.
# Conclusion
My journey into IT started long before my professional career, driven by a natural passion for technology. These early YouTube projects were more than just fun experiments—they were the foundation of my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. As I continue advancing in IT, I bring with me the same enthusiasm, curiosity, and drive that have fueled my journey from the very beginning.
