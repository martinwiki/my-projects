# my-projects
hello everyone! This git-page demonstrates my projects which I have completed over my time developing my skillset as a heavily IT inspired individual, this will cover my exposure dating all the way back to around 2010. The purpose of this Git is to demonstrate my capabilities to implement complex solutions, demonstrate my understanding and overall display my level of competence.
