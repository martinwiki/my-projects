# My-GitHub
Hi, my name is Martin Prochazka, You can find my linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-prochazka-830056168/) | This git-page demonstrates my projects which I have undertook purely to satisfy my curiosity over the course of my life, developing my skillset & understanding as a heavily IT inspired individual. This will cover my exposure to networking, network security and troubleshooting dating all the way back to around 2010 (when i was a kid). The purpose of this Git is to demonstrate my capabilities to implement & understand complex solutions and to overall display my level of competence.

# Legacy & Early Projects
- [My YouTube Channel](youtube%20channel.md) – Dating back 15 years, showcasing my technical know-how at the age of 12.
# Packet Tracer Projects
[Enterprise Network with Multi-Site Connectivity](Enterprise%20Network%20with%20Multi-Site%20Connectivity.md)  
This project simulates an enterprise with multiple branch offices, demonstrating:
- ✅ OSPF dynamic routing for scalability
- ✅ VLAN segmentation for security & traffic isolation
- ✅ Inter-VLAN routing & trunking
- ✅ Redundancy with HSRP and EtherChannel

[ISP-Level Network with BGP & MPLS](SP-Level%20Network%20with%20BGP%20%26%20MPLS.md)  
Simulating an ISP network handling multiple customer connections, including:
- ✅ BGP for inter-domain routing & internet connectivity
- ✅ MPLS for efficient traffic engineering & QoS optimization
- ✅ Load balancing for redundancy and fault tolerance

[High-Security Network with Firewalls, VPNs, and ACLs](High-Security%20Network%20with%20Firewalls%2C%20VPNs%2C%20and%20ACLs.md)  
A network security lab implementing:
- ✅ Cisco ASA firewalls to protect network perimeters
- ✅ Site-to-Site & Remote-Access VPNs for secure communication
- ✅ ACLs to restrict access and enhance security
- ✅ AAA authentication for user & device access control

[Data Center Network with Load Balancing & Failover]  
A data center simulation ensuring high availability and efficiency with:
- ✅ Layer 3 EtherChannel for high-speed redundant links
- ✅ HSRP/VRRP for gateway redundancy & failover protection
- ✅ Load balancing strategies for web traffic optimization

Network Automation & Optimization  
Demonstrating modern automation techniques for efficient network management:
- ✅ Python & Netmiko for automated device configuration
- ✅ Ansible for centralized network deployment & management
- ✅ QoS policies for VoIP and critical traffic prioritization
- ✅ NetFlow & SNMP for network monitoring & traffic analysis

Each project includes:  
📂 Packet Tracer files for hands-on simulation  
📜 Configuration scripts for implementation guidance  
📝 Documentation & explanations for educational purposes  

🚀 Stay tuned for continuous updates as I explore more advanced networking and security concepts!
